### Useful resources

- [BEM Methodology](https://9elements.com/bem-cheat-sheet/) - This helps me to know where exactly I'm working on so I don't have to create classes with some weird names haha.
- [Josh Comeauâ€™s CSS reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - This reset makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need to be reset.
